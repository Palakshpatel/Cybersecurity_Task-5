# Elevate Labs - Cyber Security Internship - Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic

## Objective
The goal of this task was to capture live network traffic using Wireshark, identify basic protocols, and analyze packet details.

## Deliverables
1.  Packet Capture file (`Task 5.pcapng`)
2.  Short Report (Detailed findings are summarized below and in the images)
3.  Supporting Screenshots

## Tools Used
* [cite_start]Wireshark (Free) [cite: 6]
* [cite_start]Command Prompt/Terminal (to generate traffic via ping) [cite: 11]

## Execution Steps

1.  **Installation:** Wireshark was installed and launched.
2.  **Capture Start:** Capturing began on the active Wi-Fi interface.
3.  **Traffic Generation:** Traffic was generated by browsing a few websites and executing a `ping 8.8.8.8` command.
4.  **Capture Stop & Export:** Capture was stopped after one minute and the data was exported as `Task 5.pcapng`.
5.  **Filtering & Analysis:** The captured data was filtered using display filters to identify and analyze key protocols:
    * **DNS:** Filter `dns` was used (See `Protocol Identification (Filter 1_DNS).png`).
    * **TCP:** Filter `tcp` was used to observe connection handshakes (See `Protocol Identification (Filter 2_TCP).png`).
    * **ICMP:** Filter `icmp` was used to analyze the ping requests/replies (See `Protocol Identification (Filter 3_icmp).png`).

## Files Submitted

* `Task 5.pcapng`: The raw packet capture file.
* `Short_Report_Task_5.pdf` (or copy the report above): Summary of protocol findings.
* `Protocol Identification (Filter 1_DNS).png`: Screenshot demonstrating DNS filtering.
* `Protocol Identification (Filter 2_TCP).png`: Screenshot demonstrating TCP filtering.
* `Protocol Identification (Filter 3_icmp).png`: Screenshot demonstrating ICMP filtering.
